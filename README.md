# Exploratory-Bikeshare-analysis
Exploratory analysis of a Washington, DC bike share dataset

For the fourth course in my Data Science master's program, Big Data Integration, one of the assignments was to find a dataset and conduct an exploratory analysis. I found this particular set on Kaggle of the Washington, D.C. capital bike share program covering 2011-2018. It captures ridership by timestamp and includes variables for a variety of weather events. 


The exploratory analysis covers basic dataset review, filling in missing values, and generating new features from the date time stamp, along with regression plots, a time series plot, and distribution plots of ridership based day of the week and weather event.
